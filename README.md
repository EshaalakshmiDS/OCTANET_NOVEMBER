# OCTANET_NOVEMBER-TASK 1

The 1st project undertaken during my Web Development Internship at Octanet Services (Nov-2023) 

## Project 1- Landing Page
The assigned task was to build a Landing Page.<br>
I aimed to create a website for a hair salon by employing HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. The objective was to provide customers with a platform to search for salons based on their specific needs, including services, prices, operating hours, and location. Additionally, they could easily find contact information for booking appointments, and the website was designed to be responsive, ensuring it could be accessed on mobile devices, tablets, and desktops.
